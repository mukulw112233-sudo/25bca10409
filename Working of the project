Working of the Project

The project “RetroTune – Old Song Player” works as a menu-driven C application that allows the user to interact with a collection of old songs using simple keyboard inputs.
It is a console-based program, meaning all interactions happen through the terminal screen using text menus and user inputs.

Here’s how the project works step by step 👇

Step 1: Program Start

When the program starts, it first loads a few predefined classic songs (like Lag Ja Gale, Yeh Shaam Mastani, Hotel California, etc.) into an array of structures.

Each song is stored in a structure of type Song, which contains:

struct Song {
    char title[100];
    char artist[100];
    int year;
};


This structure stores the title, artist, and release year of each song.

Step 2: Displaying the Main Menu

Once the program starts, it displays a simple main menu:

==============================
 🎶 RetroTune - Old Song Player 🎶
==============================
1. View All Songs
2. Play a Song
3. Add a New Song
4. Exit


The user is asked to enter a choice (1–4) to perform a specific action.

Step 3: Viewing Songs

If the user selects Option 1,
the function displaySongs() is called.
This function prints all songs currently available in the library.

Example output:

🎵 --- Old Songs Library --- 🎵
1. Lag Ja Gale - Lata Mangeshkar (1964)
2. Yeh Shaam Mastani - Kishore Kumar (1971)
3. Hotel California - Eagles (1976)
4. Imagine - John Lennon (1971)

Step 4: Playing a Song

If the user selects Option 2,
the program first displays the song list and asks the user to enter the song number they want to play.
Then the function playSong() is called, which simulates playing that song by displaying:

▶️ Now Playing: Hotel California by Eagles (1976)
Enjoy the music... No ads, just vibes! 💿


(Note: Actual music playback is simulated through text output.)

Step 5: Adding a New Song

If the user selects Option 3,
the function addSong() is called.
The program asks the user to enter:

Song Title

Artist Name

Release Year

After the user enters the details, the new song is stored in the array and added to the main song list.

Example:

Enter song title: Tum Hi Ho
Enter artist name: Arijit Singh
Enter release year: 2013

✅ Song added successfully: Tum Hi Ho - Arijit Singh (2013)

Step 6: Exiting the Program

If the user selects Option 4,
the program ends gracefully with a goodbye message:

👋 Thanks for using RetroTune! Enjoy your music.

Step 7: Looping Mechanism

The entire program runs inside a while loop, allowing the user to perform multiple actions repeatedly until they choose to exit.
This makes it function like a real app menu where you can view, play, and add songs continuously.
